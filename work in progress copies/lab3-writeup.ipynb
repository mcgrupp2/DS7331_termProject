    "The dataset selected for this project was collected by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics over the course of 1994 and 1995 for the Current Population Survey (CPS). The main purpose of the CPS is to obtain current information on the status of the labor force in the United States. More specifically, this survey is conducted to enumerate the number of jobless and unemployed individuals as well as to get an idea about the social well-being of the citizens.\n",

    "The Current Population Survey was developed in the late 1930s after the Great Depression, as prior there was not an effective technique to classify the labor force. A great need arose for a reliable survey of the population after this period of widespread unemployment. Previously, there were several indirect surveying techniques employed, however there were great discrepancies between these methods. The first surveys began in the 1940s and responsibility for conducting the survey has changed hands in the government, but currently, the survey portion is conducted by the US Census Bureau and the data is analyzed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CPS is conducted monthly and is administered by asking a series of questions pertaining to socioeconomic factors of roughly 60,000 probability sampled households from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Eligible candidates must be over the age of 15, not in the Armed Forces, or in an institution such as a prison, nursing home or long-term health care facility. Typically, labor force questions are asked pertaining to eligible workers in the household, in addition to supplemental questions asked that are of particular interest to labor force analysts. These subjects range greatly in the both the frequency in which they are asked, as in, annually, biannually, or one-time, as well the topics. Supplemental survey topics which vary monthly and cover questions relating to many differing topics, such as veterans status, child support, displaced workers, fertility, disability, school enrollment, just to name a few.\n",
