    "The dataset selected for this project was collected by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics over the course of 1994 and 1995 for the Current Population Survey (CPS). The main purpose of the CPS is to obtain current information on the status of the labor force in the United States. More specifically, this survey is conducted to enumerate the number of jobless and unemployed individuals as well as to get an idea about the social well-being of the citizens. This data was obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning repository, which a citation and a direct link to the dataset can be found [here](https://www2.1010data.com/documentationcenter/prod/Tutorials/MachineLearningExamples/CensusIncomeDataSet.html). \n",

In our scenario, we are trying to predict whether the income is over or under 50k and graduation (whether the individual graduated from high school or college). Accuracy is a good metric to look at when we have balanced datasets. "

We went with the stratified method since this a binary classification problem and we want balanced classes. Especially, since we are working with a large number of values, the balance is important which stratified helped us achieve. This is so that the data is arranged in a way that every fold comprises of half the instances. This will also prove useful because we want to see which one our three models will do well using this type of cross validation. "
