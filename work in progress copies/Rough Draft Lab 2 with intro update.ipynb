    "The dataset selected for this project was collected by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics over the course of 1994 and 1995 for the Current Population Survey (CPS). The main purpose of the CPS is to obtain current information on the status of the labor force in the United States. More specifically, this survey is conducted to enumerate the number of jobless and unemployed individuals as well as to get an idea about the social well-being of the citizens. This data was obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning repository, which a citation and a direct link to the dataset can be found [here](https://www2.1010data.com/documentationcenter/prod/Tutorials/MachineLearningExamples/CensusIncomeDataSet.html). \n",
